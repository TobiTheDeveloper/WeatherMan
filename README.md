Weather Dashboard Web App

Overview:
The Weather Dashboard Web App is a user-friendly application that allows users to check the current weather conditions and forecast for a specific location. This app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and responsive experience for users to stay informed about the weather.

Features:
Search by Location: Users can enter the name of a city or location to view the current weather conditions and forecasts.

Current Weather: The app displays the current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), humidity, and wind speed.

5-Day Forecast: Users can also see a 5-day weather forecast that includes the temperature and weather conditions for each day.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the structure of the web page, including input fields and placeholders for weather data.

CSS: Styles the user interface, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate.

JavaScript: Manages the dynamic aspects of the app, including fetching weather data from a weather API and updating the UI with the received data.

Installation and Usage
Clone the repository or download the source code.

API Integration
The app integrates with a weather API to fetch weather data for the specified location. To use your own API key, follow these steps:

Sign up for a free API key from a weather service provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';

Save the changes and the app will now use your API key to fetch weather data.
